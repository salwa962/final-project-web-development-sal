The Little Star's Journey
    In a small village in the African savannah, there was a young boy named Kofi who loved to stargaze. Every night, he would lay on the grass and look up at the twinkling stars, dreaming of adventures beyond his village. One night, a little star fell from the sky, landing softly beside Kofi.
    The star was scared and lost, far from its home in the sky. Kofi, determined to help, decided to embark on a journey to return the star to its place. With his trusty lantern and a heart full of courage, Kofi and the star set off on their adventure.
    They traveled through dense forests, crossed rivers, and climbed mountains, meeting various animals who offered their help along the way. Each challenge they faced only strengthened their bond and resolve. Finally, after a long journey, they reached the highest peak where the star could return to the sky.
    With a final hug, Kofi let go of the star, watching it rise and shine brightly among its friends. The star promised to watch over Kofi and his village, reminding him that even the smallest acts of kindness can light up the darkest nights.
